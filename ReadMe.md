# Debate Analyzer

This repository analyzes Presidential debates using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python packaging and dependency management. [JupyterLab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/) is used for documentation and implementation!

Install Poetry and then start the lab:

```console
uname@os:~$ poetry shell 
uname@os:~$ poetry install
uname@os:~$ jupyter-lab 
```
